GECO Version History:
1.0 16-Nov-92  GPW  Initial public release.
2.0 29-Nov-93  GPW
 - Changed the license to the GNU Library General Public License
 - Minor patches for compatibility with other Lisps
 - Added documentation
 - Added some support for sequencing problems
 - Added support for minimizing vs maximizing, including renaming the
   organism "fitness" slot to "score"
 - Added more selection methods, generalized existing ones to work with
   both minimizing and maximizing GAs
 - Removed phenotype support from the organism class and added a mixin
   for when it is needed
 - Removed the statistics slot from the genetic-plan class and deleted
   the plan-statistics class, since it's not used by GECO.  If you need
   it, define a subclass.
 - Replaced printable-allele-set with printable-allele-values and
   allele-values
 - Renamed count-allele-values to count-allele-codes
 - Renamed mutate-chromosomes to mutate-chromosome
 - Renamed make-population-vector to make-organisms-vector
 - Renamed some of the files (changed "_" to "-")
 - Deleted unused function copy-population
 - Created GECO-USER package and moved examples to it.
 - Added conditional compilation features to select the random number
   generator, and support lisps which don't implement tail-recursion
   optimization
 - Added max-organism and min-organism slots to the
   population-statistics class
 - Miscellaneous efficiency improvements
 - Even fixed a bug or two B^)
2.0.1 9-19-94  GPW
 - Fixed a bug in the EIDETIC method for organisms which surfaces when
   comparing organisms with no chromosomes.
2.1 11-12-20   GPW
 - Converted documentation to PDF. It's also been updated and improved.
   There are two versions: normal printable, and hyperlinked.
 - Moved the change history (the data in this file) from the README file.
 - Converted text files to unix line-endings (LFs, instead of CRs)
 - Changed the calling sequence for the normalize-score generic function
   and methods (removed the stats argument, since it's not needed)
 - Fixed errors in bibliography of documentation
 - Fixed error in pmx-cross-organisms to fix a bad arglist for
   pmx-cross-chromosomes
 - Fixed an error in the shared-initialize :after method for the
   gray-code-translation class
 - Rewrote pick-random-chromosome-index to more accurately do its job as
   documented
 - Renamed pick-locus-index to pick-random-locus-index, for consistency
 - Modified the 
 - Converted from MK-Defsystem to ASDF. This entailed moving a number of
   files to subdirectories to correspond to the modules in geco.asd
 - Updated copyright dates
 - New versions of the demo files: sb-test.lisp, allele-counts.lisp, and
   ss-test.lisp
 - For the :geco-standard-cl-random feature, coerce the argument to
   geco-random-float to a floating point number
2.1.1 12-9-20  GPW
 - Fixed a small bug in methods/organism-methods.lisp related to floating
   point conversion that was discovered when testing under SBCL.
 - Added some templates to illustrate how to initialize lisp development
   environments to incorporate GECO.
 - Updated the documentation to reflect the current GECO version, the lisp
   initialization templates, and a bit more information about the
   sb-test.lisp and ss-test.lisp files.
 - Deleted the old GECO-README.txt file, which has been superseded by the
   README.md file, which has also been updated.
2.1.1.a 12-11-20  GPW
 - I neglected to add some of my local LaTeX style files to the Docs
   directory. These are now included.
